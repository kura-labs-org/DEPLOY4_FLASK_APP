# Deployment 4

For this deployment, we have to deploy three different applications using Python - Flask - AWS Beanstalk.
In order to complete the work, I have used some open source resources cited below.
The detailed documentation is in the [PDF](https://github.com/ibrahima1289/DEPLOY4_FLASK_APP/blob/main/Dplymnt4_apps_IDiallo.pdf) file linked to this repository.

## 1. Url Shortener

This web application displays a short version of url, see this [link](https://github.com/ibrahima1289/DEPLOY4_FLASK_APP) for source codes.

## 2. To Do List app 

For this web application, a todo list is created, then, items can be updated, and/or deleted from the list. See [link](https://github.com/ibrahima1289/HW-todo-api) for source codes.

## 3. Costum app: Calculator

The BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator gives the user some advice whether or not to lose/gain weight to stay healthy. Here are the source codes in this [link](https://github.com/ibrahima1289/calculator).
